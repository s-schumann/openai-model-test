Template for testing the OpenAI API
===================================

Technologies used:

- Node.JS
- Express & Axios Node.JS modules
- Docker

The service runs both a web frontend and a backend for frontend service (BFF) querying the OpenAPI API and sending the result to the frontend.

This repository has been used to try [Replit](https://replit.com/) and various Docker deployments (locally, CapRover, Rancher).
